👋 Hi there! My name is Kyle Levenick, and I don't really know what I'm doing here.

I'm joking—mostly. But in the spirit of climbing out of the deepest rut I’ve ever been in, several people encouraged me to start a pet project. The first idea that came to mind? A blog. So… here we are!

## Who I Am

I'm an IT professional with over 10 years of experience, most of it in higher education IT. I started out working helpdesk, ran and owned the hardware repair process throughout my undergrad and graduate years, and now serve as the Program Director for IT Security & Risk at Texas A&M University.

I’m sure if you’re reading this, you definitely know what a Program Director does. But just in case: think of me as the right-hand to our CISO. When our CISO wants something to happen, I’m the one who gets it off the ground and moving. My job is to make sure our entire cybersecurity vertical is rowing in the same direction.

On any given day, I might be dealing with vendors, contracts, software implementations, internal politics, project and product management, and more. No two days are the same, and it’s often a challenge just to keep my head above water. But somehow, I stay afloat. This blog is my attempt to document those efforts, share lessons learned, and offer insights into the reality of working in higher education at a large R1 institution—all through a “people first” lens.

## "People first"? What does that mean?

My first academic love was psychology. I’ve always loved talking to people, working with them, and figuring out what makes them go. Both my undergraduate and master’s degrees are in psychology, and if we were in a different timeline, I might be doing therapy, continuing my education, maybe even chasing a doctorate.

But we’re not in that timeline. We’re in the one where I got into IT during college—and fell in love with that more than psychology.

That said, I still try to operate every day with the mindset that technical problems are really just people problems in disguise. They exist because of people, are made worse by them, but—most importantly—are also solved by them. Understanding how people think and work is the first real step toward making meaningful change, both personally and professionally.

At the end of the day, approaching technical issues with a people-first mindset means recognizing that most of what we call “IT problems” are really just organizational change problems.

## Wait, what does layer 8 logic mean?
If you’ve ever worked in IT, you’ve probably heard someone jokingly refer to “Layer 8” of the OSI model. Officially, the OSI model stops at Layer 7—but unofficially? There’s a hidden eighth layer: the people. And they’re usually the trickiest part of the stack.

Tech is easy. People? Not so much.

I chose the name Layer 8 Logic because so many of the challenges we face in IT, cybersecurity, and leadership aren’t technical at all—they’re human. Miscommunication, misaligned incentives, cultural resistance, burnout, bureaucracy… those are Layer 8 problems. Solving them takes more than tools and tech; it takes empathy, psychology, patience, and sometimes a little humor.

This blog is about exploring that messy, fascinating, people-filled layer—from the perspective of someone who lives in the intersection of cybersecurity, higher ed, and organizational leadership. If you’re into the human side of tech, you’re in the right place.
